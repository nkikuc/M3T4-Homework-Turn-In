#### Journal entry 1, Benefit From the Spread of Deep Fake Technology

I'm usually not the type to fall asleep in class, but Damon's history class is different. He just uses Vir-Tube videos that gets generated from his notes. We just sit and watch one of the default Virtual Actor talking, occasionally with awkward hair and eye movement that looks like a smudge of acrylic paint. I think today's *lecture* (or AI generated video's talk, to be more accurate) was something about old photography. At least according to my abstracted squiggly notes, that's what is written. It was about photography back When we still duplicated imagery of "real" human beings. I felt weirdly nostalgic about this. Even though it's about a time when I was still not even born. It wasn't that hard to imagine being taken an image of myself. I would probably never do it, for obvious privacy hazard if it was spread somewhere.

Today, Aaron, who was sitting towards my left generated a video story of me rocking my head during Damon's class (as mentioned above, usually I am **not** the type to fall asleep. Damon's class is just an exception...). Just the idea that this could've been a "live action" me literally recorded if it was a few decades back made me slightly scared. The video Aaron took was just an AI generated "avatar (deep faked version)" of me so there isn't anything too embarrassing. I mean, it is still kind of embarrassing, just not too embarrassing when I compare it to a theoretical "real" footage of me falling asleep. I edited my avatar that's generated so it looks and moves nicer. After all, it's only a near copy of me that I decided I felt confident enough it can be shared. But, I guess this was the part where my curious nostalgia came in about the older photographs in today's class. Those photographs felt so connected to the photographed people. I weirdly missed that connection in my photographs. I'll never do it, because it's too risky and embarrassing. But, it does sound kind of nice. Only kind of.

#### Journal entry 2, Screwed Over From the Spread of Deep Fake Technology

Wait, don't most guys choose a female avatar when they play games? No? Is it that weird that I have the AI generate me as a female for my videos and photos? I keep on getting questions about me being queer or transgender or other one of the LGBTQ+ but that's not the case. I simply enjoy myself being *kawaii* online. So Aaron, stop taking random vids' (short for video) of me during class just make fun of me setting the converter as a *nice looking* girl, plz.

But let's compensate about this for a moment. Is there any point to keep yourself looking the way you are for these phot's (photo) and vid's (video)? If you want to keep a record of yourself to look at later, wouldn't it be more enjoyable to keep that record in the nicest looking version? I'm straight, that's why I enjoy looking at nice looking girls more than a hairy, disgusting, gross, beast-like male (which is me). No, just giving a slight editing on my skin doesn't change it. There will still be a correlation to the real life me. I want to distance away as much as I can from the real me when I'm on the AI generated world. Do you get it? It's not *that* weird if you think about it. So stop fricking buggin' me around for the photos I upload, seriously.
