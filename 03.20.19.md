### FUTURE DIARY 1.0
##### (This is an excerpt from an interview with the director Eddie Warren on his 25th anniversary since the release of his first AI generated film *Will Electric Sheep Dream of Androids?*)

(*When asked about the filming process with the live actor.*) Typically, we call them (eye actors) pretty early in the process. The (eye) Actors tend to come up with surprising ideas that none of the production designers ever even thought of. Especially when it comes to things about the characters. So it works better if they come at the earlier stage where we are still brushing up on the screen play and other design elements. We usually ask the live (eye) actor to come for about a two day shoot. The actual shooting is pretty short. The truth is, for most actors, we already have a lot of footage of the actors to feed to our AI. The reason for the live actor is really for their eyes to merge onto the AI generated footages' eyes. This helps the footage look far more real and alive. It's really about the eye.
