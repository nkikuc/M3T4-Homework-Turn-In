###Deep Fakes

In April of 2018, Buzzfeed released a video of President Obama warning the viewer, “We’re entering an era in which our enemies can make it look like anyone is saying anything at any point in time, even if they would never say those things.” Later in the video, it was revealed that this video was only a digitally manipulated footage of comedian Jordan Parker.  This video served as a warning to the internet users the power of the technology known as *Deep Fakes*. It is a machine learning technology that is able to map a persons face onto another person in a video. The term was first introduced in 2017 when a user on the internet billboard *Reddit* introduced clips of celebrity such as Daisy Ridley and Gal Gaddot's face mapped onto porn star's face. The Reddit user called this Deep Fakes. This practice stirred many ethical debates including lawmakers that rushed to send a letter to the Director of National Intelligence to assess the potential threat that this technology possesses. By February 2018, Pornhub banned the distribution of Deep Fakes.
The videos are created by feeding the machine sequence of frames with the face of the person you want to map. The machine analyzes the spatial and temporal information to learn how to map the face. On average it takes about 12 hours to create a minimally convincing video. Many free softwares are available online to create a Deep Fake, the most popular one being *FakeApps* that was developed by the same Reddit user who first introduced the porn footage

###Blockchain

Blockchain, a concept first introduced by the pseudonymous internet user by the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. It is a large interconnected Computers (Nodes) that continues to keep a list of data records. Nakamoto's idea was that this should theoretically allow a fail proof decentralized system for keeping track of information. This concept was used the next year for a cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin, created by Nakamoto. The technology is still quite young and has not been implemented on major public services. But cryptocurrency, which is developed on top of the Blockchain system is gaining momentum as Japanese bank Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and JP Morgan Chase is starting to develop its own cryptocurrency.

###Zero Knowledge Proof

Zero Knowledge Proof was an idea first developed by a group of MIT researchers Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, and Charles Rackoff in a paper called  *“The knowledge complexity of interactive proof systems”*. The idea was to come up with a way to validate that you know a certain fact with out sharing any content or method of how you know the truth to the verifier. In a context of a computer, it takes is an algorithm that takes a certain input and simply return true or false. The analogy to explain this concept goes like this; A blinded person hides a black ball and a white ball under the table. You must prove to him that balls are actually two different colors. The blinded person brings a white ball up first. Then he hides the ball back under the table. The blinded person can either switch the ball to a black ball, or keep it the white ball. You only tell the blinded person wether he had switched the ball or not. Here, you have succeeded in proving that the ball does have different colors without revealing any details. Of course if it is only done a single time, the blind person might think you have gotten lucky, but by testing multiple times the chance of getting it correct by luck becomes infinitely close to 0. In 2012, a variation of Zero Knowledge Proof by the name zk-Snarks (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) was introduced by Nir Bitansky, Ran Canetti, Alessandro Chiesa & Eran Tromer. It was designed specifically for use in Crypto Currency. It was implemented in the cryptocurrency Zcash to make money transactions more private to prevent common problems cryptocurrency such as "front running" where a user sees a pending transaction and goes ahead to make that transaction ahead of time, for what ever the reason (generally seen in stock trade).

###Biohack Microchip

A Swedish piercing parlor Jowan Osterlund, in 2014 started to develop a new company, Biohax. Osterlund's idea was to physically implant a Near Field Communication chip (NFC chip).  This enables the implanted person to unlock doors, pay, etc only through the Microchip. The company is still only starting up, but he has implanted more than 4,000 people just in Sweden alone. He has been invited to other companies across Europe to implant the Microchip for scanning into the company, paying for the cafeteria, and other functions. He is currently training a group of doctors and nurses to work for his company. Osterlund also commented that the 2020 Tokyo Olympics Committe also came to see if they can implement this to smoothen the game. The company is still in the midst of developing its security and privacy features, but it is a promising industry for the future of technology.

###Stories

On April 2013, Snapchat, developed by Stanford students Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, added a feature called "My Story". It introduced a refreshing new interface that displayed a short video or photograph for a controlled amount of time sequenced in chronological order. It all disappeared after 24 hours. It became the most used feature on the app. The idea was that it was all tailored for browsing on the phone. The videos and photos would be the dimension on the phone. The feature was soon copied onto Instagram. This feature allowed the user to share instant casual footage through instagram's camera. After its implementation on August, the usage of the feature doubled the number of Snapchats'. Recently facebook has also added the feature to its app. Facebook’s chief product officer, Chris Cox commented on this format last year, saying “(story) is on a path to surpass feeds as the primary way people share things with their friends sometime next year.”
